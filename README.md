# ClearML Datasets

## Introduction

This is the toy example of the project with image datasets.

It contains some of the most popular datasets, namely:
- CIDFAR10;
- MNIST;
- Fashion MNIST.

## Local environment setup

This section describes steps needed to create a local environment where you can start to work with the code.

### Step 0: Enter the repository page

[Here](https://github.com/IooHooI/clearml_datasets) is the link to the respective repository on GitHub.

### Step 1: Cone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/IooHooI/clearml_datasets.git
```

### Step 2: Enter the root repository folder

```shell
cd clearml_datasets
```

### Step 3: Create a conda environment from environment.yaml file

```shell
conda create python=3.8 --file environment.yaml
```

### Step 4: Activate an environment

```shell
conda activate clearml_datasets
```

## How To...

This section gives an overview of what (and how) you can do with your datasets.

Basically, there are several actions you can do with your data, namely:
- Create a new Dataset entity;
- Upload data to your dataset;
- Add some meta-info about your Dataset;
- Create a new version of the previous Dataset entity;
- Compare Datasets.

Below are steps with more detailed description of code snippets/commands/etc.
